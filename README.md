# Quantum-Computing-Project-Linear-Equation-Solver
I implemented the IBM Qiskit library to create a Linear Equation Solver. This was my first Quantum Computing Project and it taught me the fundamental concepts of how these programs work. I am really excited to see where computing goes in the next decades, so I will definitely work on more projects related to this.
